# You can use basic operators on Strings, just like other objects:

my_string   = "Face"
your_string = "book"

my_string + your_string  # => "Facebook"

my_string == your_string # => false, double == means is equal to, this is the equality operator
my_string = "book" # single = means equals, it is the assignement operator
my_string == your_string # => true
